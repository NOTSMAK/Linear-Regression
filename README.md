**Part 1: Generating Synthetic Data**

Objective: Create a dataset to understand the basics of linear regression.
Data Generation:
X: Random independent variable.
y: Dependent variable with a linear relationship (y = 4 + 3*X + noise).
Visualization: A scatter plot of X vs. y shows a linear relationship with noise.

**Part 2: Defining a Linear Model in PyTorch**

Model: nn.Linear(1, 1) defines a simple linear regression model with one input and one output feature.
Loss Function: Mean Squared Error (torch.nn.MSELoss) evaluates the difference between predicted and actual values.
Optimizer: Stochastic Gradient Descent (torch.optim.SGD) adjusts model parameters to minimize the loss.

**Part 3: Training the Model**

Training Loop:
Convert X and y into PyTorch tensors.
Perform forward pass (prediction), compute loss, backpropagate gradients, and update weights.
Repeat for 100 epochs.
Progress Check: Log the loss every 10 epochs to monitor improvement.

**Part 4: Visualizing the Trained Model**

Post-Training:
Generate predictions using the trained model.
Plot the regression line on the scatter plot to illustrate how well the model fits the data.

**Part 5: Real-World Application with California Housing Dataset**

Dataset: Used fetch_california_housing() to predict housing prices based on median income.
Data Preparation:
Selected 1000 random data points for simplicity.
Visualized initial data to observe potential linear relationships.
Model Training:
Similar setup as the synthetic data, using nn.Linear(1, 1).
Trained for 100 epochs and monitored the loss.
Post-Training:
Plotted the regression line on the dataset to assess the modelâ€™s performance.

**Key Concepts**
Linear Model: Maps input to output via a straight line.
Loss Function: Measures prediction errors; MSE penalizes large errors.
Optimizer: Adjusts weights to minimize loss via gradient descent.
Training: Repeatedly refines the model using forward pass, loss computation, and backpropagation.

**Takeaways and Next Steps**
Linear regression is a foundational concept for understanding machine learning.
Analyzing loss trends and adjusting hyperparameters like learning rate can improve training.
Transitioning to real-world datasets, such as California Housing, highlights practical applications.
